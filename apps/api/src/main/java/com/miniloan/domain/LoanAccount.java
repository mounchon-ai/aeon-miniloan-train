/**
 * บัญชีสินเชื่อ (ENT-006 · STM-miniloan-002 · BR-miniloan-014@v1).
 *
 * <p><b>One application, one account.</b> The unique constraint on {@code applicationId} is that
 * rule (AC-miniloan-060 · AC-miniloan-132) — the database refuses the second account rather than a
 * disabled button doing it, which is the fence CLAUDE.md puts on every retryable write.
 *
 * <p>{@code interestRateVersionId} is a REFERENCE, not a copied number (BR-miniloan-037@v1 ·
 * AC-miniloan-104): an account opened under an old version still reads that version rate after two
 * more have been published.
 *
 * <p><b>Closing is two doors and no others</b> (BR-miniloan-021@v1). {@link #close} is the only way
 * the status leaves Active, it demands a {@link CloseReason}, and {@link CloseReason} has exactly
 * the two values ENT-006 declares — so a third way to close cannot be expressed here at all, let
 * alone reached. Closed is final: {@link #close} on a closed account throws rather than moving the
 * timestamp, which is AC-miniloan-007's "ปิดซ้ำไม่ได้" at the layer that owns the invariant.
 *
 * <p><b>What is deliberately not here.</b> ENT-006 declares no account number, while AC-miniloan-058
 * renders
 * "เลขบัญชีเลขที่ {เลขบัญชี}" — the account id IS that number, raised for design with the other
 * enumeration gaps rather than answered with a second identifier nobody asked for.
